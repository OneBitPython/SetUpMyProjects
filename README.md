# SetUpMyProjects
This is a repository that I am making solely to explain how to set up all my projects. For main GUI projects, I have two ways of setting up my projects

1. Requirements.txt

To setup my project using requirements.txt, first, you have to clone the repository (this is if you have git), to clone just say - 
git clone <web url>
This web url can be found by clicking the clone button in the top right and copying the link given.
  
If you don't have git installed, you can first download and then extract the project.
After this, you need to go to the installed directory and say 
pip install -r requirements.txt, this installs the required files
  
Finally,just say 
python MAIN.py 

### OR
  
python main.py
  
  
2. main.exe
Sometimes, an exe file will be available, in this case all you need to do is download the repo and run the main.exe file. Make sure that this exe file is in the same directory as the other files.
